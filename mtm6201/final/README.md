This web portfolio is a short resume for me, which included my introduction, works, and contact. As for how I am built my web portfolio, I finish coding HTML page first then gives proper css code for it. During that step, I am also using bootstrap to do some basic media queries to support different device to browse the website. 

The biggest challenge during I build this website could be arrange the css file. For instance, there are too many tags in the web page, so that it might have conflict  that tags have same names. The way that I solve this issue is giving a clear and concise id name  or class name while I am creating the tag so that it can be easy to read or retrieve. It really saves my time and helps me clearly understand which part I am working on.  

Before I develop this portfolio, I was create one css file for each HTML, it will charge may space and waste many times, also is complicated. Finally, I know how to make all css in one file, furthermore, by adding boostrap on it, css file become more sample and easier.
