                Hi there! My name is Huilin Chen, also known as Camille.
                I am from <strong>Guangdong</strong> which is a south part of <strong>China</strong>.
                I have done my EAP program at Algonquin college in Aug 17<sup>th</sup>,2020.
                My hobbies are photography and design.
                I want to be a We Media worker, and I am learning video editing by myself.
                So I choose the <b>IMD program</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before I attend this course, I have taken an online HTML course in <mark>Udemy</mark>.
                I'd like to learn some foundations of HTML before the course, and it can help me to get the point from
                the professor easier.
                And the fact is，it really helpful for my HTML learning.
                Furthermore, when I began to enter the HTML field to learn I feel so <u>excited</u> and
                <u>interested</u> in it.
                I hope that I can get more knowledge from this course.
            </p>
